						<h2>What is Ethereum?</h2>
						<p>Bitcoin is the original blockchain-based digital currency. It was originated by Satoshi Nakamoto, the mind behind blockchain, as an anonymous, decentralized alternative to traditional currencies.</p>
						<p>Bitcoin can be sent from user to user, traded for other crypto or fiat assets, or stored like any traditional financial asset. The difference is that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency. That means no reliance on central banks or intermediaries.</p>
						<p>Bitcoin is produced by miners who mine Bitcoin blocks on the blockchain. Its mining cap is set at 21 million coins to protect the value of its tokens.</p>
						<h2>What is Ether?</h2>
						<p>Ether is the coin mined on the Ethereum cryptocurrency. Instead of being purely a currency, like other major coins, Ether coins are used to fuel the activities of the Ethereum blockchain. Ether assets can be stored in an Ethereum wallet.</p>
						<p>There is no set limit on Ether production and its circulation is currently over 100M</p>

						<h2>How can I open an Ether wallet account?</h2>
						<p>Opening an Ether wallet with Coin Wallet is fast and hassle-free. You can create your Ether wallet from your computer or mobile device without providing any personal information.</p>
						<h4>The process is simple:</h4>

						<ol class="vertical-steps">
							<li>Select ‘Create new wallet’</li>
							<li>You will be given a unique passphrase. This is your only way to access your Ether wallet address/account.<br> This information cannot be retrieved if lost, so it is essential to record it in a secure place.</li>
							<li>From here, you’re ready to send and exchange tokens with the app. You can buy tokens with credit card, Google Pay, Apple Pay, or your existing crypto assets.</li>

						<h2>Use an anonymous Ethereum wallet</h2>
						<p>Coin Wallet wallets keep your transactions completely secure and anonymous. We store zero personal data, meaning that your account is virtually impossible to compromise.</p>
						<p>The most important thing to remember about using an anonymous Ethereum wallet is that no one can access your wallet except you – not even us. That means that your passphrase must be kept in a secure location because it cannot be retrieved from any database if lost.</p>

						<h2>Advantages of Ether</h2>
						<p>Ethereum has been a leading blockchain since its launch in 2015. Ether coins, like Bitcoin and other major coins, can be transferred between parties.</p> 
						<p>In addition to being a cryptocurrency, Ethereum blockchain provides smart contracts functionality and is used for the development of applications and software in a growing number of industries. Among multi-billion dollar companies exploring blockchain, over half of them are developing with the Ethereum platform.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-4">
						<h2>Advantages of using an Ethereum wallet app</h2>
						<p>An Ethereum wallet is necessary to buy, sell, or store Ether tokens. They provide direct access to the blockchain and an interface to view, trade, or spend your Ether.</p>
						<p>All your Ether transactions happen through your wallet, which is why it’s important to select a wallet provider that has strong security measures in place and can facilitate fast transactions.</p>
