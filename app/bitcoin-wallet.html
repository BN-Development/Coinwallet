						<h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
						<p>Ethereum is a blockchain developed after the Bitcoin blockchain. It produces Ether cryptocurrency and is a ledger system that organizations can use to build their own decentralized applications and smart contracts.</p>
						<p>Ethereum expands on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is only a payment system. Etherum is a more dynamic system that can be used as a digital lever. In addition to producing Ether currency, the Ethereum-based applications are used by organizations in fields like health care, finance, and government</p>

						<h2>How can I open a Bitcoin wallet account?</h2>
						<p>Opening a Bitcoin wallet with Coin Wallet is fast and hassle-free. You can register your Bitcoin wallet account from your computer or mobile device without providing any personal information.</p>

						<ol class="vertical-steps">
							<li>Select ‘Create new wallet’</li>
							<li>You will be given a unique passphrase. This is your only way to access your Bitcoin wallet account. This information cannot be retrieved if lost, so it is essential to record it in a secure place.</li>

						<h2>Use an anonymous Bitcoin walle</h2>
						<p>Coin Wallet wallets keep your transactions completely secure and anonymous. We store zero personal data, meaning that your account is virtually impossible to compromise.</p>
						<p>The most important thing to remember about using an anonymous Bitcoin wallet is that no one can access your wallet except you — not even us. That means that your passphrase must be kept in a secure location because it cannot be retrieved from any database if lost.</p>

						<h2>Advantages of Bitcoin</h2>
						<p>As the first and most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is a strong asset both for trading and for everyday use.</p>
						<p>Bitcoin is accepted at dozens of major retailers including Starbucks, Whole Foods, and Nordstrom, and this list is constantly expanding. Plus, Bitcoin has lower transaction fees than major credit cards like Visa and MasterCard.</p>
						<p>Bitcoin’s blockchain-based mining and peer-to-peer, decentralized network means that transactions are secure and independent of centralized financial institutions.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-4">
						<h2>Advantages of using a Bitcoin wallet app</h2>
						<p>A Bitcoin wallet is necessary to buy, sell, or store Bitcoin tokens. They provide direct access to the blockchain and an interface to view, trade, or spend your Bitcoins.</p>
						<p>All your Bitcoin transactions happen through your wallet, which is why it’s important to select a wallet provider that has strong security measures in place and can facilitate fast transactions.</p>
